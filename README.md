# Xaeros Hax

A hacky mod to change some stuff in xaero's minimap and xaero's worldmap.

**Requires Both minimap and worldmap installed**

Features:

- Extended zoom scale in minimap
  - Changed increment size from 1 to 0.25
  - Changed range from 1 -> 5 to 0.25 -> 5
- Ignore clear glass in map
  - Sort of behaves like how maps work in-game
- Cross dimension waypoints (nether and overworld)
  - Adding a waypoint in overworld will automatically add a waypoint in nether at the nether coordinates of that location.
- Nether roof in minimap and world map
  - Going above the nether roof will show above the nether roof map instead of under the roof
  - Looks amazing if you have piston bolt network or ice highways on the roof.
